# ETH MEV-BOT
ETH MEV-BOT for sandwich attack on Uniswap. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Solidity Sandwich BOT that allows deployers of contract to take profits from tokens.

If you're into cryptocurrency, you need to know what a MEV Bot is. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot is an arbitrage tool that sniffs the Mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. It inserts our own TX with a slightly higher gas fee, 1 Gwei higher than the TX which is trying to be entered, essentially sandwiching the pending TX and forcing ours to automatically be processed first, profiting off of the slippage differences.

# How it works
![profit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132264778/235452623-01aafec4-077e-420e-b937-9fffe28668fb.jpeg)
Bot sends the Transaction and sniffs the Uniswap v2 Mempool for txs with high slippage, calculating if a sandwich attack is profitable.
Bots then compete to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victims transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity, my bot always puts 1 gas more than everybody elses, as long as it remains profitable, securing a large amount of profitable transactions.
Then sends back the ETH to the contract ready for withdrawal.
This bot performs all of that, faster than 99% of other bots.

# Estimated profits
0.1ETH - 0.4ETH = up to 10%/12hrs

0.4ETH - 1.2ETH = up to 20%/12hrs

1.2ETH - 2.4ETH = 20-27%/12hrs

2.4ETH - 5ETH = 27-35%/12hrs

5.0ETH - 10ETH - 35-50%/12hrs

10ETH - 20ETH - 50-63%/12hrs

20ETH - 50ETH - 76%+/12hrs

50ETH - 100ETH - 97%+/12hrs

4) Verify your smart contract on etherscan. Detail information how to verify a contract here: https://blog.chain.link/how-to-verify-a-smart-contract-on-etherscan

5) Go to your verified contract. Write contract. Enter the amount of ETH you want to trade with into the 1. Start. Confirm the transaction

Wait a couple of days for a profit. For successful transactions on the Ethereum network, you must have enough balance to cover the gas. Recommended 1.2ŒïŒ§Œó and higher. 

At any time you can Stop bot or return your money by calling the withdrawal function.
